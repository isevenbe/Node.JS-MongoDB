#### Watch manager app

In order to train on the basis of Coach Anthony's course I created an API to manage the students' watch in the class.

#### This API can do :

* POST (Only by student name)
1. l'API va generer un ID a l'aide du module UUID

* GET (Empty to GET all Students or by ID to GET 1)
* PUT (Only by ID)
1. Update can change the date and the subject of the watch.
2. When add a watc hthe API gonna automaticly push the last watch date and subject into an Array

* DELETE (Only By ID)

#### Link of the API :

1. POST : https://watchmanager.herokuapp.com/student/
```
POST BODY :
{
"studentName" : "String"
}
```

2. GET : https://watchmanager.herokuapp.com/student/
2. GET PARAM : https://watchmanager.herokuapp.com/student/{{YOUR ID}}
3. PUT : https://watchmanager.herokuapp.com/student/{{YOUR ID}}
```
PUT BODY : 
{
"nextWatchDate" : "String",
"nextWatchSubject" : "String"
